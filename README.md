## Description of Visualization
We can implement a [bar chart race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3w8I8boc_I) to encode number of fatalities/collisions across time per pedestrian (or driver) action attribute value. If we want to simulate pedestrians being run over in the chart where each bar visually appears to be a lane, we might need to slow down the time progression at each point where a new bar chart attribute value is being introduced. Optionally, we can do this by removing the "race" part of the bar chart race by fixing the bar positions (no bars overtake each other).

We need an interactive segment in the visualization too, so we can either (1) make each bar clickable, and when clicked, opens a new visualization (stacked bar chart is probably easiest) or (2) allows us to switch datasets for the bar chart race (i.e. go from representing pedestrian actions to pedestrian condition or driver actions etc.)
